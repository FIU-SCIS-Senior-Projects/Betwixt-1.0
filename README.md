### Pull Request (PR) Process 🚀

When picking up a story to work on, you should do the following:

1. Create your own branch off of `phonegap` with the following format, `<storyType>/<storyNumber>`. Story types are: `feature`, `spike`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`.
    - For example, if the story type you're working on is a **feature** and the story number is **123**, then the branch name will be: `feature/123`.

2. After you're done working on your story, create a pull request and add yourself as an "Assignee" and the other members of the team as "Reviewers". Please do not hesitate to write comments on PRs, we are here to learn from each other!
